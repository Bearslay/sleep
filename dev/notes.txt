PROGRAM
Todo:
    - Add popups for transition points
        - display time until point (when warning)
        - display time until buffer ends (when main & buffer enabled)
        - no popup for buffer
    - Get Pi to detect plugged in phone
    - Add interface to enable/disable uptime/downtime
        - also be able to disable warnings/buffers independently
    - Get some amount of data collection
        - How long phone is plugged in each night
        - When phone is plugged in/unplugged
    - Figure out why some colors aren't accurate on the Pi

Ideas/Features:
    - Alt downtime/uptime editing system
        - change uptime and automatically set downtime
        - have universal offset for sleep duration (core)
        - have univseral offsets for buffers and warnings (bonus)
    - Have extra alarms
